4642253:Since the flavour rotations A are approximate, not exact, symmetries, each orthogonal <h1>state in the vector space</h1> corresponds to a different particle species. In the example above, when a proton is transformed by every possible flavour [[[rotation]]] A, it<h2> turns out that</h2> it moves around an 8-dimensional vector space. Those 8 dimensions <h1>correspond</h1> to the 8 particles in the so-called "baryon octet" (proton, neutron, Sigma baryon, [[Xi baryon|, ]], [[Lambda baryon|]]). This corresponds to an 8-dimensional ("octet") representation of the group SU(3). Since A is an approximate symmetry, all the particles in this octet have similar mass.
